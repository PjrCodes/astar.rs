// TODOs:


// add a new button to the UI that opens a modal to set the benchmark parameters. there is a button that lets u run the benchmark and closes the checkbox
// the benchmark should update the UI at every iteration with the graph
// folder choosing option -- maybe just a text box
// you can run either the pre-generated benchmarks using the random seed or give your own folder
// it should update the UI and tie in with Nikhil's Import/Export


fn main() {
    // read 
}
// build a map that's solvable
